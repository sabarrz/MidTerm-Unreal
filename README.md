# MidTerm-Unreal
 midTerm
The idea is to find the cube, jumping on it and opening the door.
The sphere tracing works with G key and the lever will be opened with Q key.
There are implementation of carrying the objects in the blueprints but I ended up not using them because they looked ugly:)
The goal is to explore the puzzle, find the cube from one side of the puzzle(hidden), bring it to the gate, jump on it and opening the door using the lever
My goal was to make multiple cylinders and doors where the player is supposed to find cubes and put them in collision with the cylinders to
keep the door open and find the right cube for the gate opening.
There are widgets helping the player identifying the goal and process.


I was sick all week and had to work and study so sorry if parts of my project are not done perfectly. I tried to meet the requirements first:))
